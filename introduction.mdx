## How It Works

Galtea helps you evaluate AI products through a repeatable test-measure-iterate cycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Product">Create a [Product](/concepts/product) to represent your AI functionality.</Step>
  <Step title="Create Version">Define a new [Version](/concepts/product/version) of your product with specific parameters.</Step>
  <Step title="Create Test">Create a [Test](/concepts/product/test) with [Test Cases](/concepts/product/test/case) to evaluate your product.</Step>
  <Step title="Run Evaluations">Execute [Evaluations](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation) for each test case against [sessions](/concepts/product/version/session) of your product version.</Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Results">Review and compare the performance of different versions using the built-in analytics tools.</Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">Develop a new version of your product and repeat the process to track improvements and regressions.</Step>
</Steps>
