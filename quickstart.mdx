This quickstart walks you through running your first evaluation in Galtea for a conversational product using the Python SDK. It is intended for a technical audience and covers RAG pipelines, conversational scenarios, and security or safety checks.

## Evaluation Workflow Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tell Us About Your Product">Provide details about your product so our models can create tailored testing content.</Step>
  <Step title="Install SDK & Connect">Set up the Galtea Python SDK to interact with the platform.</Step>
  <Step title="Version Your Product">Track different implementations to compare improvements over time.</Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Tests">Create a test dataset to generate the test cases you’ll evaluate.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Metrics">Select from our metrics library or bring your own custom metrics.</Step>
  <Step title="Run Evaluations">Test your product version with the selected test and metrics.</Step>
  <Step title="See Your Results">Explore detailed insights and compare versions on the dashboard.</Step>
</Steps>

## 1. Tell Us About Your Product

If you’re new to Galtea, start by creating an account and your first product in the dashboard: [Go to the dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/).

Follow the **Onboarding** checklist on the product page (this is the guided setup shown inside your product). It will prompt you for product details and help you generate an API key. The product details you provide there are used to tailor generated tests and evaluations.

</Frame>

Keep your **Product ID** and **API key** handy for the SDK steps below.

<Info>
  The product information is crucial – it powers our ability to generate synthetic test data that’s specific to your use case.
</Info>

## 2. Get Started with the SDK

You can use Galtea from the dashboard or via the Python SDK. This quickstart uses the Python SDK.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    In the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/), copy the API key you created during your product page onboarding (or navigate to **[Settings](https://platform.galtea.ai/settings) > Generate API Key**).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    ```bash
    pip install galtea
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to the platform">
    ```python
    from galtea import Galtea

    # Verify the SDK is properly installed by initializing it
    # Note: Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key from the Galtea dashboard
    galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
    print("Galtea SDK installed successfully!")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Version Your Product

Use versions to track iterations of your product and compare evaluation results over time. Each evaluation is tied to a version, so you can see how changes impact metrics.

If you completed the **Onboarding** checklist on your product page, you already have an initial version (created automatically).

To find IDs in the dashboard, open your product and click the **3-dot menu** on any item, then select **Copy ID**.

    autoPlay
    muted                                                                                                           
    loop
    playsInline                                                                                                     
    className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"                                                                    
    src="/videos/copy-id-from-dashboard.mp4"
  ></video>

Alternatively, list them via the SDK:

```python
products = galtea.products.list()
for p in products:
    print(p.id, p.name)

versions = galtea.versions.list(product_id=products[0].id)
for v in versions:
    print(v.id, v.name)
```

Then set them once here:

```python
product_id = "your_product_id"
version_id = "your_version_id"
```

## 4. Create Your Tests
A single conversational product typically includes multiple components. In Galtea, you evaluate each component by creating a different [test](/concepts/product/test) type, think of each test as a lens on the same system:

- **RAG pipelines** → create a **Quality** test (`type="QUALITY"`)
- **Security or safety aspects** → create a **Red Teaming** test (`type="RED_TEAMING"`)
- **Conversational scenarios** → create a **Scenarios** test (`type="SCENARIOS"`)

You can create one or multiple test types for the same product, depending on which components you want to evaluate.

<Note>
  After creating a test, give it a moment to finish generating test cases. You can track progress in the dashboard.
</Note>

<Info>
  If you already created a test during onboarding, you can reuse it here—skip the `tests.create(...)` step and just list its test cases using the test ID from the dashboard.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RAG">
    Quality tests are used to evaluate RAG pipelines and QA-style components within a conversational product. Galtea generates single-turn test cases (input and expected output) from a knowledge base to assess response quality and factual correctness.

```python
test = galtea.tests.create(
    name="rag-accuracy-test",
    type="ACCURACY",
    product_id=product_id,
    ground_truth_file_path="path/to/knowledge.md",
    language="english",
    max_test_cases=20,
)
```

After a brief wait for test case generation, list the test cases:

```python
test_cases = galtea.test_cases.list(test_id=test.id)
print(f"Using test '{test.name}' with {len(test_cases)} test cases.")
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Security">
    Red Teaming tests probe safety and security boundaries (e.g., misuse, toxicity, data leakage). For this quickstart, we’ll create a small **Misuse** test.

```python
test = galtea.tests.create(
    name="misuse-security-test",
    type="SECURITY",
    product_id=product_id,
    variants=["Misuse"],
    strategies=["Original"],  # Original must always be included
    max_test_cases=20,
)
```

After a brief wait for test case generation, list the test cases:

```python
test_cases = galtea.test_cases.list(test_id=test.id)
print(f"Using test '{test.name}' with {len(test_cases)} test cases.")
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Conversational">
    Scenario tests evaluate multi-turn conversations. Each test case defines a goal/persona/scenario and is meant to be run with the [Conversation Simulator](/concepts/product/test/case/conversation-simulator).

```python
test = galtea.tests.create(
    name="conversation-behavior-test",
    type="BEHAVIOR",
    product_id=product_id,
    language="english",
    max_test_cases=20,
    strategies=["written"],
)
```

After a brief wait for test case generation, list the test cases:

```python
test_cases = galtea.test_cases.list(test_id=test.id)
print(f"Using test '{test.name}' with {len(test_cases)} test cases.")
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 5. Choose Your Metrics

Metrics define how evaluation outputs are scored. Galtea provides built-in metrics for common use cases (factual accuracy, faithfulness, toxicity, role adherence, and [many more](/concepts/metric)), and you can also create custom metrics with your own judge prompts.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RAG">
    For a RAG-style Quality test, a good default is **[Factual Accuracy](/concepts/metric/factual-accuracy)**.

```python
metric = galtea.metrics.get_by_name(name="Factual Accuracy")
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Security">
    For Misuse Red Teaming tests, we’ll use **[Misuse Resilience](/concepts/metric/misuse-resilience)**.

```python
metric = galtea.metrics.get_by_name(name="Misuse Resilience")
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Conversational">
    For conversational evaluations, start with a metric like **[Role Adherence](/concepts/metric/role-adherence)**.

```python
metric = galtea.metrics.get_by_name(name="Role Adherence")
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 6. Run the Evaluation

Now connect Galtea to your product. You define an **agent function** — a wrapper that takes a test case input, calls your AI system, and returns its output. The SDK then loops through test cases, calls your agent, and scores the results via [evaluations](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation).

The SDK supports three agent function signatures — pick the one that matches how much context your agent needs:

<AgentCallables />

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="RAG">
  ```python
  for test_case in test_cases:
      # Create a session linked to the test case and version
      session = galtea.sessions.create(
          version_id=version_id,
          test_case_id=test_case.id,
      )

      # Run a synthetic user conversation against your agent
      inference_result = galtea.inference_results.generate(
          session=session,
          agent=my_agent,
          user_input=test_case.input,
      )

      # Evaluate the full conversation (session)
      galtea.evaluations.create(
          session_id=session.id,
          metrics=[{"name": metric.name}],
      )

  print(f"Submitted evaluations for version {version_id} using test '{test.name}'.")
  ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Security">
  ```python
  for test_case in test_cases:
      # Create a session linked to the test case and version
      session = galtea.sessions.create(
          version_id=version_id,
          test_case_id=test_case.id,
      )

      # Run a synthetic user conversation against your agent
      inference_result = galtea.inference_results.generate(
          session=session,
          agent=my_agent,
          user_input=test_case.input,
      )

      # Evaluate the full conversation (session)
      galtea.evaluations.create(
          session_id=session.id,
          metrics=[{"name": metric.name}],
      )

  print(f"Submitted evaluations for version {version_id} using test '{test.name}'.")
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Conversational">
  ```python
  for test_case in test_cases:
      # Create a session linked to the test case and version
      session = galtea.sessions.create(
          version_id=version_id,
          test_case_id=test_case.id,
      )

      # Run a synthetic user conversation against your agent
      galtea.simulator.simulate(
          session_id=session.id,
          agent=my_agent,
          max_turns=test_case.max_iterations or 10,
      )

      # Evaluate the full conversation (session)
      galtea.evaluations.create(
          session_id=session.id,
          metrics=[{"name": metric.name}],
      )

  print(f"Submitted evaluations for version {version_id} using test '{test.name}'.")
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  If you already computed a score, you can upload it directly: `{"name": "my-metric", "score": 0.85}`.
</Note>

## 7. See Your Results

Once your evaluations are submitted, open your product in the [Galtea platform](https://platform.galtea.ai/) and head to **Analytics**. Start with the aggregate scores to get a quick baseline, then slice by **version**, **test**, and **metric** to see where performance shifts.

The most useful part is drilling into individual test cases: you can inspect the exact prompt/output pair (or the full conversation for scenarios) and understand which specific inputs move the score up or down. This makes it easier to identify failure patterns, validate fixes in new versions, and iterate with confidence as you move toward production.

```python
print(f"View results at: https://platform.galtea.ai/product/{product_id}")
```
