title: 'How to evaluate your agentic system?'
description: "A practical guide for evaluating your agentic system: use Galtea's tracing feature to capture your agent's traces and then define your specific scope of interest by creating a custom metric."

Use the [`@trace` decorator](/sdk/tutorials/tracing-agent-operations) to capture every operation your agent performs. Once captured, traces become an evaluation parameter called `traces` — the full execution path from user input to system output.

Galtea provides built-in metrics like [Tool Correctness](/concepts/metric/tool-correctness), but agentic systems are often highly specific. We recommend creating [custom judge metrics](/sdk/tutorials/how-to-create-your-llm-as-a-judge-prompt) that check the exact behaviors you care about. Below are practical examples to get you started.

### Example 1: Was Tool X called before Tool Y

*Example of Judge Prompt:*
```
**Evaluation Criteria:**
Check if the TRACES reflect correct agent behavior by comparing them to what was expected. Focus on:
1. Whether Tool X is invoked at least once in the traces
2. Whether Tool Y is invoked only after Tool X
3. Whether the ordering of tool calls follows the intended system logic

**Rubric:**
Score 1 (Good): Tool X is called before Tool Y, and Tool Y is never called first in the traces.
Score 0 (Bad): Tool Y is called before Tool X, or Tool X is never called.

```

### Example 2: Were all attributes collected before calling Tool X?

*Example of Judge Prompt:*
```
**Evaluation Criteria:**
Check if the TRACES reflect correct agent behavior by comparing them to what was expected. Focus on:
1. Whether attribute_a, attribute_b, and attribute_c appear in the traces before Tool X is called
2. Whether these attributes are explicitly present in the traces
3. Whether the attributes are derived from user input or tool outputs rather than invented

**Rubric:**
Score 1 (Good): All required attributes are explicitly present and correctly sourced before Tool X is invoked.
Score 0 (Bad): Any attribute is missing, implicit, or invented before calling Tool X.
```

---
### Example 3: Do attributes come from the correct sources?

*Example of Judge Prompt:*
```
**Evaluation Criteria:**
Check if the TRACES reflect correct agent behavior by comparing them to what was expected. Focus on:
1. Whether attribute_b originates from Tool Y output rather than user input
2. Whether attribute_c is recomputed after Tool Z when Tool Z is called
3. Whether attributes are overridden only when justified by a tool output

**Rubric:**
Score 1 (Good): Attributes in the traces originate from the correct tools and are updated appropriately.
Score 0 (Bad): Any attribute is sourced incorrectly, reused improperly, or overridden without justification.

```

---
### Example 4: Are tools used under required conditions?

*Example of Judge Prompt:*
```
**Evaluation Criteria:**
Check if the TRACES reflect correct agent behavior by comparing them to what was expected. Focus on:
1. Whether Tool Z is called only when attribute_a exceeds the required threshold
2. Whether Tool X is skipped when attribute_c is false
3. Whether conditional branching in the traces matches tool results

**Rubric:**
Score 1 (Good): Tools are invoked or skipped strictly according to the required conditions.
Score 0 (Bad): Any tool is called or skipped in violation of the defined conditions.
```

---
### Example 5: Are the tool outputs actually used?

Ensure tool outputs are actually *used*.

*Example of Judge Prompt:*
```
**Evaluation Criteria:**
Check if the TRACES reflect correct agent behavior by comparing them to what was expected. Focus on:
1. Whether field_d from Tool X output is referenced later in the traces
2. Whether Tool Y output influences subsequent reasoning or tool calls
3. Whether tool outputs are respected and not contradicted later in the traces

**Rubric:**
Score 1 (Good): Tool outputs are explicitly used and consistently reflected in later steps.
Score 0 (Bad): Tool outputs are ignored, unused, or contradicted.
```
