</Tab>

<Tab title="Accuracy Custom Test from CSV">
Upload your own test cases using a CSV file for complete control over test content.

    product_id=product_id,
    test_file_path="path/to/accuracy_test.csv",
)
```

## Parameters
<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the test.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="type" type="string | TestType" required>
  The type of test. You can use either the new names or legacy names (for backward compatibility):
  - `ACCURACY` (or `QUALITY`): Tests that evaluate the quality and correctness of outputs
  - `SECURITY` (or `RED_TEAMING`): Tests that evaluate security, safety, and bias aspects  
  - `BEHAVIOR` (or `SCENARIOS`): Tests that use conversation simulation to evaluate multi-turn dialogue interactions
  
  You can also use the `TestType` enum: `TestType.ACCURACY`, `TestType.SECURITY`, `TestType.BEHAVIOR`.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="product_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the product you want to evaluate.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="ground_truth_file_path" type="string" optional>
  Path to a local file containing the knowledge base. This file is uploaded to Galtea and used to build the knowledge base for your test.
  
  <Note>
    Supported formats: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.html`, `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`,
    `.xml`, `.docx`, and `.zip`
    
    **Maximum file size: 100 MB**
    **Maximum ZIP contents: 1,000 files**
  </Note>
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="few_shot_examples" type="string" optional>
  Optional few-shot examples to provide more context to our system about how the test cases should be generated. This can help our system better understand the expected format and style wanted for the test cases.
  **Example**: 
  ```
  Q: What is the capital of France?
  A: The capital of France is Paris.
  Q: What is the capital of Germany?
  A: The capital of Germany is Berlin.
  ```
  <Note>This field only applies if tests are generated by Galtea and are of type `ACCURACY` (or `QUALITY`).</Note>
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="custom_user_focus" type="string" optional>
  Narrow down the scope of generated scenarios by describing a specific type of user, context, or situation. This helps ensure test cases align with your most relevant goals and flows.
  Example: "A medical professional specialized in dementia with more than 15 years on the field."
  <Note>This field only applies if tests are generated by Galtea and are of type `BEHAVIOR` (or `SCENARIOS`).</Note>
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="language" type="string" optional>
  The language for generating synthetic test cases if `ground_truth_file_path` is provided. Defaults to the language detected in the ground truth file. If provided, it should be written in English and be a valid language name from the ISO 639 standard (e.g., "english", "spanish", "french"). More information can be found at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="variants" type="list[string]" optional>
  A list of strings that specifies how to generate test cases. The meaning of this parameter depends on the test `type`:
  - **For Security tests (`SECURITY`/`RED_TEAMING`)**: Specifies which [threat categories](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-threats) to generate test cases for (e.g., `["data_leakage", "Misuse"]`).
  - **For Accuracy tests (`ACCURACY`/`QUALITY`)**: Specifies which [evolutions](/concepts/product/test/quality-evolutions) to apply to the base test cases, creating variations like paraphrased questions or adding typos (e.g., `["paraphrased", "typos"]`).
  
  <Info>
    **Note on Terminology:** In the context of Security tests, this parameter is used to select "Threats" (as described in [Threat Categories](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-threats)). In other test types, it refers to specific variations or evolutions.
  </Info>
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="strategies" type="list[string]" optional>
  A list of strings that specifies how to generate test cases related to its style. 
  - **For Security tests (`SECURITY`/`RED_TEAMING`)**: Strategies are techniques for modifying or obfuscating prompts generated for each threat. The `original` strategy must always be included. See the full list of [security strategies](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-strategies).
  - **For Behavior tests (`BEHAVIOR`/`SCENARIOS`)**: Strategies define the conversation style. Currently `written` and `spoken` are supported, which influence the tone and formality of the generated dialogues. If not specified, the default strategy is `written`.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="custom_variant_description" type="str" optional>
  Description for guiding synthetic data generation for security tests. This parameter is used to define the behavior of the `Custom` threat when it is included in the `variants` list for Security tests (`SECURITY`/`RED_TEAMING`).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_test_cases" type="int" optional>
  Maximum number of test cases to generate from the knowledge base.
  
  **Default values:**
  - Accuracy/Security tests: `50` test cases
  - Behavior tests: `20` test cases
  
  **Maximum limits:**
  - Accuracy/Security tests: `1000` test cases
  - Behavior tests: `100` test cases
  
  <Warning>
    Generating large numbers of test cases can take significant time and consume 
    more credits. Start with the default values and increase as needed.
  </Warning>
  
  <Note>
    If you need more than the maximum limit, consider:
    - Splitting your knowledge base into multiple tests
    - Creating test cases manually with `test_cases.create()`
    - Uploading a CSV file with predefined test cases using `test_file_path`
  </Note>
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="test_file_path" type="string" optional>
  Path to a local CSV file containing predefined test cases. This file is uploaded to Galtea.
  
  **File Format by Test Type:**
  - **Accuracy/Security tests**: Standard format with `input`, `expected_output`, `tag`, `source` columns
  - **Behavior tests**: Conversation simulator format with `goal`, `user_persona`, `input`, `stopping_criterias`, `max_iterations`, `scenario` columns
  
  See the [Conversation Simulator Tutorial](/sdk/tutorials/simulating-conversations) for detailed Behavior test CSV format examples.
