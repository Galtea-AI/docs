The Product Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [products](/concepts/product) that you want to evaluate.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.products` object.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).
</Info>

<Note>
  It is not supported to create product from the sdk, therefore you need to do this from the [dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/).
</Note>

## Quick Example

First, initialize the Galtea SDK:
```python
galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

List all products:
```python
products = galtea.products.list(limit=10)
```

Get a product by ID:
```python
product = galtea.products.get(product_id=product_id)
```

Get a product by name:
```python
product = galtea.products.get_by_name(name=product_name)
```

<Note>
  Products must be created through the [Galtea Dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/product-new). The SDK provides read-only access.
</Note>
