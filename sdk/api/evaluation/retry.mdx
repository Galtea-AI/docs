- `errors` (list[str]): Error messages for any failed retries.

## Example
```python
result = galtea.evaluations.retry(id="eval_abc123")
print(f"Retried: {result['retried']}, Skipped: {result['skipped']}")
```

## Parameters
<ResponseField name="id" type="str | list[str]" required>
  Single evaluation ID or list of evaluation IDs to retry. Only evaluations with status `FAILED` can be retried.
</ResponseField>

## Retry Limits

<Note>
Non-admin users are limited to a fixed number of retries per evaluation (default: 5). Once exceeded, the evaluation cannot be retried by regular users. For additional support or to increase retry limits, contact support@galtea.ai.
