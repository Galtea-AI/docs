title: 'Set Context'
description: "Set Galtea context values for trace correlation."
---

## Returns
Returns a context token that must be passed to `clear_context()` for cleanup.

## Example
```python
trace_context = set_context(inference_result_id=inference_result_id)
```

## Parameters
<ResponseField name="inference_result_id" type="string">
  The inference result ID to associate traces with. All subsequent traces will be linked to this ID.
</ResponseField>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Always use `set_context()` with a `try/finally` block to ensure `clear_context()` is called even if an exception occurs.
</Tip>

## How It Works

When you call `set_context()`, it attaches the provided ID to the current OpenTelemetry context. Any traces created by `@trace` decorated functions or `start_trace()` will automatically include this ID as an attribute, enabling:

1. **Trace Correlation** - All traces are linked to the same inference result
2. **Automatic Export** - Traces are batched and exported to Galtea API
