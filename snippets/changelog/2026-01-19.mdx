<Update label="2026-01-19" description="OTel Tracing, New Models, and UX Improvements">
## Standardized Tracing with OpenTelemetry

Galtea Traces have been upgraded to use the **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** standard. This major infrastructure update aligns our tracing capabilities with industry standards, paving the way for future seamless integrations with your existing observability tools and monitoring stacks. [Read more about traces](/concepts/product/version/session/trace).

## New Models Available

We have expanded the selection of models available for evaluating your products. You can now leverage the latest capabilities of:
- **Claude-Sonnet-4.5**
- **GPT-5.2**, **GPT-5.1**, **GPT-5**, and **GPT-5-mini**

These models can be selected when configuring your [Custom Judge metrics](/concepts/metric/custom-judge).

## Revamped Onboarding & Development Modes

We've improved the onboarding experience to better match your workflow:
- **Use-Case Based Onboarding:** The setup process is now split between two clear paths: evaluating a product during **Development** or monitoring a product in **Production** with real users.
- **Platform View Modes:** You can now select your preferred view mode in the platform: **Development** or **Production**. This automatically filters the UI to remove unnecessary options, keeping your workspace clean and focused on the task at hand.
