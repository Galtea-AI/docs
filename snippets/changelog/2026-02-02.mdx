<Update label="2026-02-02" description="Single-Turn Evaluations & Bulk Actions">
## Evaluate Single-Turn Interactions

You can now [run evaluations on specific single turns](/sdk/api/evaluation/create#evaluating-a-single-inference-result) (even when directly [creating an Inference Result](/sdk/api/inference-result/create-and-evaluate)), rather than being restricted to evaluating full threads or sessions. This granularity allows for more precise analysis, enabling you to pinpoint and score individual exchanges within a larger conversation context without the noise of the surrounding dialogue.

## Bulk Actions in Tables

We've enhanced table functionality across the dashboard to improve your productivity. You can now select multiple rows to perform actions in bulk, such as deleting multiple [Test Cases](/concepts/product/test/case) or cleaning up old [Sessions](/concepts/product/version/session) simultaneously.
