<Update label="2025-12-18" description="Agent Tracing & Observability">
## Full Visibility with Agent Tracing

You can now add **[Traces](/concepts/product/version/session/trace)** to your [Sessions](/concepts/product/version/session) and [Inference Results](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result). This unlocks deep observability into your AI agents, allowing you to understand exactly what they are doing at each step of execution—not just the final output.

Traces capture internal operations such as:
- **Tool Calls:** API requests, calculations, or data fetching.
- **Retrieval Steps:** Vector database searches and RAG context retrieval.
- **Chain Orchestration:** Internal routing and decision-making logic.
- **LLM Invocations:** Prompts sent to underlying models.

With the new **[Trace Service](/sdk/api/trace/service)** in the SDK, you can visualize the full execution tree, debug errors, analyze latency for specific operations, and audit agent behavior with granular detail.
