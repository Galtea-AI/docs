## Run Inferences and Evaluations from the Platform

You can now execute inferences and run evaluations directly from the Galtea dashboard. This new capability allows you to quickly test your [Product](/concepts/product) [Versions](/concepts/product/version) and validate performance without writing a single line of code or switching to your IDE.

This streamlined workflow is perfect for:
- Quick sanity checks on new model versions.
- Running specific test cases ad-hoc.
- Validating changes instantly before full-scale testing.
