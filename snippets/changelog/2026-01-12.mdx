## AI-Assisted Product Onboarding

Getting started with Galtea got even simpler. We've improved the [Product](/concepts/product) creation flow by simplifying the integration of AI assistance directly into the product creation form. The system helps you draft comprehensive product descriptions, capabilities, and security boundaries, ensuring your product context is perfectly optimized for our test generation engine from day one.

## Enhanced Inference Result Visualization

We have revamped how [Inference Result](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result) metrics are visualized. The new layout provides a clearer breakdown of performance data, making it easier to correlate specific input/output pairs with their respective scores. This improvement allows for quicker diagnosis of issues within specific conversation turns.
