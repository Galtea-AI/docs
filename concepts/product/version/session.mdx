## What is a Session?

A session groups the turns of a single conversation between a user and your AI product. It contains one or more [inference results](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result) (input/output pairs) and can be evaluated as a whole using conversational metrics.

Sessions are created in two ways:
- **Automatically** — when you call `evaluations.create_single_turn()` with a `version_id` and `test_id`, a session is created behind the scenes.
- **Manually** — when you need to log multi-turn conversations or production data, create a session explicitly with `sessions.create()`.

You can create, view, and manage sessions programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/session/service).

## Session Properties

<ResponseField name="Custom ID" type="Text" required>
  The custom ID associated with the session.
  This is usually a client-side generated ID that identifies the conversation session between a user and a LLM app.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Version" type="Version" required>
  The version associated with the session.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Test Case" type="Test Case" optional>
  The test case associated with the session. This is typically used for non-production evaluations.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Is Production" type="Boolean" optional>
  Indicates whether the session is a production session. This is typically used to differentiate production data from test data.
  It should be set to `True` if there is no associated test case.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Context" type="Text" optional>
  The context provided to the AI product during the session or ground-truth related context.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Metadata" type="Object" optional>
  Additional custom metadata about the session. This can be used to store any relevant information that doesn't fit into the other fields.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Error" type="Text" optional>
  Any error message associated with the session. This is useful for tracking failed sessions or sessions that encountered issues.
</ResponseField>
