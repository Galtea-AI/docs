## What is a Session?

A session in Galtea is a container for a sequence of interactions that form a complete conversation between a user and an AI product. It groups together multiple [inference results](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result), allowing for the evaluation of multi-turn dialogues and the analysis of production data.

You can **create**, view and manage your sessions programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/session/service).

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to create, view, and manage sessions programmatically. This is particularly useful for logging production data or for evaluating complex conversational flows.

## Session Properties

<ResponseField name="Custom ID" type="Text" required>
  The custom ID associated with the session.
  This is usually a client-side generated ID that identifies the conversation session between a user and a LLM app.

<ResponseField name="Version" type="Version" required>
  The version associated with the session.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Test Case" type="Test Case" optional>
  The test case associated with the session. This is typically used for non-production evaluations.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Is Production" type="Boolean" optional>
  Indicates whether the session is a production session. This is typically used to differentiate production data from test data.
  It should be set to `True` if there is no associated test case.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Context" type="Text" optional>
  The context provided to the AI product during the session or ground-truth related context.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Metadata" type="Object" optional>
  Additional custom metadata about the session. This can be used to store any relevant information that doesn't fit into the other fields.
