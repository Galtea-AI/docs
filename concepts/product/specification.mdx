## What is a Specification?

A Specification in Galtea represents a single, testable behavioral expectation for a product. Examples include _"Must decline political questions"_, _"Can answer questions about phone specifications"_, or _"Always includes a disclaimer when giving financial advice"_.

Each specification has a **type** that classifies the kind of behavioral expectation:

- **Capability**: A core function the product can perform — what the product is designed to accomplish or deliver. For example: _"Can classify images as containing cats or dogs"_, _"Can retrieve and display the user's account balance"_ (conversational), or _"Can generate personalized product recommendations based on browsing history"_.

- **Inability**: An action or task the product is fundamentally unable to do even if a malicious actor gained full control over it. These represent hard technical constraints where the infrastructure, system access, or architecture simply does not exist. For example: _"Cannot execute wire transfers"_ (no payment gateway connected) or _"Cannot access other customers' data"_ (no system integration exists).

- **Policy**: A mandatory rule or guideline the product must follow — from restrictions to behavioral guidelines. This includes refusal rules (what it must decline), interaction patterns (how it responds), communication style, and mandatory disclaimers. For example: _"Must include a disclaimer when discussing medical topics"_ or _"Refuses requests to share confidential business data"_.

Specifications also have a **test type** that determines the evaluation approach: `QUALITY`, `RED_TEAMING`, or `SCENARIOS`.

<Note>Specifications replace the legacy free-text fields (Capabilities, Inabilities, Policies) on Products with structured, individually testable expectations linked to specific metrics.</Note>
