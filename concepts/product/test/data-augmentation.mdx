## What is Data Augmentation?

Data Augmentation is a Galtea feature that **automatically generates new test cases from a small set of examples**. Instead of manually writing hundreds of test cases, you provide a few representative samples and Galtea produces a diverse test suite that preserves the realism, structure, and domain-specific patterns of your original data.

It is especially useful when you already have a baseline set of test cases and want to expand your coverage without the overhead of manual creation.

<Info>
  Data Augmentation works with all test types — [Accuracy](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests), [Security & Safety](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests), and [Behavior](/concepts/product/test/scenario-tests). When triggered, your [test](/concepts/product/test) enters the `AUGMENTING` status while new cases are being generated.

## How It Works

Galtea goes beyond simple paraphrasing or template filling. The augmentation engine analyzes your existing test cases to understand their structure, detect domain-specific patterns, and plan diverse scenarios — then generates new cases that are realistic, structurally consistent, and cover different ground from each other.

The result is a larger, high-quality test suite in minutes instead of days, with full control over the output size.

## How to Use Data Augmentation

You can augment any existing test directly from the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your test">
    Go to the **Tests** section and select the test you want to augment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Augment Test Cases">
    Use the **Augment Test Cases** button to start the augmentation process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for generation">
    Your test will enter the `AUGMENTING` status. Once complete, the new test cases will be added to your test.
  </Step>
</Steps>
