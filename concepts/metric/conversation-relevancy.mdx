title: "Conversation Relevancy"
description: "Checks if your product consistently responds in a contextually relevant way during a multi-turn conversation."

The **Conversation Relevancy** metric is one of several [non-deterministic Metrics](/concepts/metric) Galtea uses to evaluate your LLM-based chatbot's ability to generate contextually appropriate and relevant responses across the course of a multi-turn dialogue. It assesses whether each response aligns with the user's intent, prior inputs, and the evolving context of the conversation.

This metric is particularly useful for ensuring coherent, on-topic conversations that maintain engagement and avoid misunderstandings or irrelevant diversions.

## Evaluation Parameters

To compute the `conversation_relevancy` metric, the following parameters are required in every turn of the conversation:

- **`input`**: The user message in the conversation.
- **`actual_output`**: The chatbot's corresponding response.

This metric will evaluate the whole conversation, including all turns, to evaluate the relevance of the response in context, not just in isolation.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `conversation_relevancy` score is computed using an LLM-as-a-judge approach:

1. **Analyze Context Flow**: The LLM reads the conversation sequentially to understand the evolving context.
2. **Evaluate Each Turn**: For every agent response, the LLM determines if it directly addresses the user's immediate input, makes sense given previous turns, and stays on-topic.
3. **Consider Natural Conversation Dynamics**: The LLM accounts for minor clarifications or brief tangents that serve a purpose, and focuses on **significant** relevance failures rather than minor imperfections.

The metric assigns a **binary score**:

- **Score 1.0 (Relevant):** The agent maintains overall coherence with only minor or justifiable deviations. Responses align with the user's intent and conversation history.
- **Score 0.0 (Irrelevant):** The agent demonstrates significant irrelevance issues—repeatedly ignoring context, contradicting established information, or going off-topic without justification.
